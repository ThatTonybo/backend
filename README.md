# New Revolt.Social Backend


- Let's talk about details first ([here](https://app.revolt.chat/invite/WY1Pc06K)) so code works for everyone
- Don't hesitate to ask me (nerrix) for anything, let it be minor questions
- Please stick with the stack as used in index.js unless we agreed on doing otherwise.


# TODO
- Vanity Invite GET endpoint (this endpoint will be called from the frontend, dont worry about routing here, it should respond with JSON, as every other endpoint).
- List bots / servers by tags
- Enforce certain tags (to be expended, incomplete list: [tags.txt](tags.txt)
- Login, Votes, Ratings? (Only when Revolt releases Oauth!)
- Edit and Delete Listings (incl. respective vanity)
- Submission of Listings (incl. respective vanity)
- Fetch bot's server count and server's user count from Revolt API
